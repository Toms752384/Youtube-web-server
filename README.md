# Youtube-web-server
Web server for youtube project.
This web server was build in MVC structure, including a routes folder to make the server more readable and moduler.

First steps : 
hii dear bodek before we start please follow the next steps  üî• -
1. clone to your own copmuter our server repo - https://github.com/Toms752384/Youtube-web-server.git
   please make sure you are on the main branch! the other branches are for other parts of the project, and for production.
3. clone to your own computer our react app for part 2! it means you need to clone the app from this repo link - https://github.com/AlonLivne007/YouTube-project-.git
   please make sure you are on main_part_2 branch! the "main" brunch is for the first part of the project.
4. Last but not least - make sure you download to your own computer the - mongoDB app. You can find it in google on their official website - use the community edition.

General description of running the code:
1. Run "npm i" to install the dependencies of the server.

2. Before running the server with nodemon, please write the followoing command in your terminal:
 "node uploadExistingVideos.js"
 This will upload the videos from the server to your local mongodb database, from a folder called "localVideos", that resides in the server.
 We chose to upload the videos that are shown in the react app, and are uploded from users in the "localVideos" folder, to support longer videos, and not in base64.
 Photos are indeed handled in base64, and stored directly in the database.

 Now you have our 20 defualt videos ü´∂.
 This will also uploud you 3 users (us - Alon, Tom , Maayan üíñ).
 After this you will be able to see in your own mongoDB -
 - 3 users
 - 20 videos
    
 It might take a few moments.

This is to make it easier for you to check the assignment üíò

3. Run the server using "nodemon server.js".
   - please notice it might not work to you beacuse you need specific permissions from your computer to run this global script so you can just do the reguler command - node server.js.

4. Enjoy!
